# .qemacs.d/libs/debian

This "debian" directory contains the contents of the `dpkg-dev-el` debian
package. This is necessary because installing that package also installs the
emacs package provided by whatever version of debian is being used. As qemacs is
dedicated to staying with the latest releases of GNU Emacs, this gets a little
confusing for users to have two different installations of the same thing.

For the licensing, please see each package file for their specific licensing
and any files under the `libs/others` path are provided *unmodified*.
