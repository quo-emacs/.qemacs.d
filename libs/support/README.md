# .qemacs.d/libs/support

The "support" directory contains Quo-Emacs configuration startup features and
functionality. The top-level `init.el` file is intended to contain as little
code directly and instead require support packages to do the actual work of
setting up any given feature.

All of these packages are provided under the [lgpl-2.1-only] license.
